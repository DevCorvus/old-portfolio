## Made with love, passion and fun 💖

The idea of building a portfolio has been around my mind for quite some time since I started this journey as a web developer, but first I wanted to finish a series of projects, which took me a long time to finish (around a year). These projects were primarily focused on learning and experience.

Each one contributed a lot to mature many of my skills and knowledge, through different technologies, philosophies and methods. The progress curve for me as a developer was practically exponential and very satisfying.

Finishing this portfolio in itself was the culmination of what I had started and marks the end of one stage and the beginning of another in my professional career as a software developer. Still, I know that I should never stop learning, especially in this field, which I personally love!

I didn't try to make an extravagant or business portfolio, just something that I could identify with; something with which to express myself and what I do. I feel like I successfully achieved that goal.

## What's next 💫

I will add new projects, content and updates whenever I see fit, which probably won't be as often as I'd like as I tend to constantly focus on new goals until I'm done with them and that can mean a bit of a delay from time to time.

In any case, I hope to continue learning and growing on this great journey through something that really interests me and about which I **developed** a passion, which was always something difficult to visualize for me and that means a lot.

Btw, thanks for reading, it means a lot to me! You'll find more details in the About section on the website and if there are any questions, suggestions or whatever, feel free to let me know.

**_Fun Fact: This repository was initially private (as well as many others) because I felt a little hesitant and insecure about making it public._**
