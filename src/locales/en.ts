			p1: "As a fullstack web developer, my knowledge and skills extend from frontend to backend and databases (primarily backend, where I'm looking to specialize). Being React, TailwindCSS, Express.js + TypeScript, MongoDB/Postgres the technological stack in which I have more experience and feel more comfortable.",
			p2: 'I like to make things from scratch, with constant tests (manual or automatic), in a logical and minimalist way, always trying to follow an organized, well-structured but dynamic development scheme, with the best practices that can be applied and that I constantly seek to improve without sacrificing flexibility. The goal of this is to prioritize user experience, scalability, performance, and overall quality, keeping in mind that this varies depending on business needs.',
			p3: 'In my experience, code is actually the least important part of any serious project. This is why I tend to focus much more on the early phases of development, which start with requirements, planning, tools, and a wide variety of factors to consider before even writing the first line of code. This speeds up the process and offers better results, especially in the long run.',
			p4: 'If I had to choose between the frontend and the backend, I would definitely choose the backend in terms of what I like to work with the most and what I feel I am best at. Although that does not mean that I leave aside the frontend and the design, since in fact it is a part where I have invested a lot of time through my projects. There are also other general knowledge and experiences in software development outside of the web for me, however, web development is where I currently carry out the vast majority of my activities.',
			p5: 'Passion for constant learning and new challenges, dedication, communication, adaptability and honesty, are usually the banner that I carry on.',

		details: {
			react:
				"React and its ecosystem (React Router, Redux toolkit, styled-components, etc) is the main JavaScript framework (as a set) I use and have the most experience with. It just feels like the most comfortable tool for me in SPA development and I love it even though I know it's not nowhere near perfect.",
			tailwind:
				'It is the main CSS framework I use, especially to increase productivity on more detailed component-based designs.',
			vue: 'Currently, this is the second framework that I have the most experience and feel most comfortable with behind React.',
			bootstrap:
				'When design is not a priority, this is usually my choice to get things done nice and quick.',
			html: 'There is no trick to using it and I always try to apply some level of SEO and accessibility.',
			css: 'I love it and hate it at the same time, CSS is such a powerful tool that it took me a while to get the hang of it. But once I did I started to take a liking to it and try to get better at it whenever I get the chance.',
			jquery:
				'The ultimate frontend library when not using a SPA framework. However, I prioritize vanilla JS and only use jQuery when really needed.',
			node: 'The NodeJS ecosystem with TypeScript is by far the one I have the most experience and knowledge of, specifically Express.js and other frameworks like Next.js and Socket.IO. I just love it when it comes to REST APIs, SSR and so on.',
			laravel:
				"To be honest, I'm not a fan of PHP, but Laravel is undeniably one of the frameworks most complete and best designed out there. If it can be done with Laravel, I would definitely choose Laravel.",
			django:
				'Django is like magic, but that magic comes at a cost, which is its flexibility. However, it is the most complete and fastest framework in which to develop and is based on one of my favorite languages.',
			postgres:
				'Postgres is the main SQL database that I use and with which I have developed most of my projects.',
			mongodb:
				'Due to its design and similarity to JavaScript syntax, MongoDB is the main NoSQL database I use and feel most comfortable working with. However, by its nature, it is not always the best option.',
			mysql:
				'MySQL was the first database that I learned and used before replacing it with Postgres, even so, it is not a problem to use it (Like all SQL databases).',
			heroku:
				"It's easy, comfortable, free and scalable. By difference, the platform that I have used the most to take my projects to production.",
			netlify:
				"Bringing frontend projects to production is just like magic when using this platform. Extremely easy, comfortable and free. However, by focusing on fullstack projects, I haven't been able to get much use out of it.",
			javascript:
				'JavaScript was not my first programming language, but it has been by far the one I have learned and gained the most experience with throughout my development journey. From top to bottom, it is the language with which I feel most comfortable and its ecosystem is the best.',
			typescript:
				'Nothing to say, JavaScript with data types, latest syntax, powerful compilation features, etc. TypeScript combines features that I love and without a doubt one of my favorite programming languages.',
			python:
				'It was my first programming language and it is still a convenient, simple and elegant way to build software for me. Its syntax is not my favorite but its design and ecosystem is just beautiful, one of my favorite languages.',
			php: 'As I said in the Laravel section, I am not in love with this language compared to other options, but I have never denied its usefulness and, in fact, I have developed considerable experience with it due to its similarity with other languages and thanks to a powerful tool like Laravel. There is no trick to use it.',
			rust: "I don't have any project developed with this language. I have literally only learned and used it as a hobby and yet it is one of my favorite programming languages and one that I see some potential for in the future.",
			git: 'The tool that every software developer must have.',
			vite: 'This is the development kit I start most of my projects with.',
			go: 'Looking for a better performing backend alternative to TypeScript but not as complex to integrate as Rust, Go has been the perfect balance between simplicity and high performance, especially for backend development. I hope to adopt it more frequently among my main work tools.',
			cSharp:
				'This is a programming language that I have always found generally very useful and comfortable (leaving aside its object-oriented approach) but I have not found an ideal use for it in my current work.',

			p5: 'Broadly speaking, I wanted the website to be simple, intuitive, accessible, very fast, scalable and good at SEO. To achieve this there was a lot of attention to detail about the user experience and I used a modern technology stack that I felt pretty comfortable with in the short and long term.',
