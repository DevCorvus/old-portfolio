The goal of this is to prioritize user experience, scalability, performance, and overall quality, keeping in mind that this varies from business to business.',
			p3: 'If I had to choose between the frontend and the backend, I would definitely choose the backend in terms of what I like to work with the most and feel I am the best at. Although that does not mean that I leave the frontend and design aside, since in fact it is where I have invested more time through my projects. There are also other general knowledge and experiences in software development outside of the web for me, however, web development is where I currently perform the vast majority of my activities.',

			react:
				"React and its ecosystem (React Router, Redux, etc) is the main JavaScript framework I use and have the most experience with. It just feels like the most comfortable tool for me in SPA development and I love it even though I know it's not nowhere near perfect.",

				'It is the main CSS framework I use, especially to increase productivity on more detailed component-based designs.',
			bootstrap:
				'When design is not a priority, this is usually my choice to get things done nice and quick.',
			html: 'There is no trick to using it and I always try to apply some level of SEO and accessibility.',
			css: 'I love it and hate it at the same time, CSS is such a powerful tool that it took me a while to get the hang of it. But once I did I started to take a liking to it and try to get better at it whenever I get the chance.',

				'The ultimate frontend library when not using a SPA framework. However, I prioritize vanilla JS and only use jQuery when really needed.',
			gulp: 'Gulp is quite a useful toolkit for managing frontend projects without a traditional framework.',
			node: 'The NodeJS ecosystem with TypeScript is by far the one I have the most experience and knowledge of, specifically ExpressJS and other frameworks like NextJS and Socket.IO. I just love it when it comes to REST APIs, SSR and so on.',
			laravel:
				"To be honest, I'm not a fan of PHP, but Laravel is undeniably one of the frameworks most complete and best designed out there. If it can be done with Laravel, I would definitely choose Laravel.",
			django:
				'Django is like magic, but that magic comes at a cost, which is its flexibility. However, it is the most complete and fastest framework in which to develop and is based on one of my favorite languages.',
			postgres:
				'Postgres is the main SQL database that I use and with which I have developed most of my projects.',
			mongodb:
				'Due to its design and similarity to JavaScript syntax, MongoDB is the main NoSQL database I use and feel most comfortable working with. However, by its nature, it is not always the best option.',
			mysql:
				'MySQL was the first database that I learned and used before replacing it with Postgres, even so, it is not a problem to use it (Like all SQL databases).',

				"It's easy, comfortable, free and scalable. By difference, the platform that I have used the most to take my projects to production.",
			netlify:
				"Bringing frontend projects to production is just like magic when using this platform. Extremely easy, comfortable and free. However, by focusing on fullstack projects, I haven't been able to get much use out of it.",
			javascript:
				'JavaScript was not my first programming language, but it has been by far the one I have learned and gained the most experience with throughout my development journey. From top to bottom, it is the language with which I feel most comfortable and its ecosystem is the best.',
			typescript:
				'Nothing to say, JavaScript with data types, latest syntax, powerful compilation features, etc. TypeScript combines features that I love and without a doubt one of my favorite programming languages.',
			python:
				'It was my first programming language and it is still a convenient, simple and elegant way to build software for me. Its syntax is not my favorite but its design and ecosystem is just beautiful, one of my favorite languages.',
			php: 'As I said in the Laravel section, I am not in love with this language compared to other options, but I have never denied its usefulness and, in fact, I have developed considerable experience with it due to its similarity with other languages and thanks to a powerful tool like Laravel. There is no trick to use it.',
